Why c++ is essential?
Really great question,main reason to switch from c to c++ is because of its ability to develop desktop apps,object+procedural language,high performance.
In competititve coding,Most of the coders across the globe use this language because of its performace,its speed is really high compared to python,java.
C++ allows you to have a lot of control as to how you use computer resources, so in the right hands its speed and ability to cheaply use resources should be able to surpass other languages
