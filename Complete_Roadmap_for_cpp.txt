*******Complete Roadmap to Learn C++********

        C++, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, is a general-purpose programming language and considered as an advanced version of the C programming language. 
It offers the rich library support in the form of Standard Template Library. The language is widely used in various GUI platforms, Cloud/Distributed Systems, Operating Systems, real-time simulations, etc. 
Moreover, as C++ is an object-oriented programming language, it allows you to implement real-time problems through OOPS concepts. 
Here in this article, let’s discuss a thorough curriculum or roadmap that one should follow to learn C++ Language in 20 days!

1. Introduction to C++ Programming (Day: 1)

Introduction to C++ Programming Language
Setting up C++ Development Environment
C vs C++
C++ vs JAVA
First C++ Program: Hello World
2. Learn DataTypes, Variables & Operators (Day: 2-3)
Now you need to know about the building blocks of C++ programming – DataTypes, Variables & Operators. You need to get a thorough understanding of data types and how 
they are used, what are variables, how they are declared and initialized, the use of operators in C++, etc. It will help you to get familiar with the basic structure 
and syntax of C++ programming. There are several other topics also to be considered here such as Reference Variables, Operator Overloading, Optional Parameters, 
and others.
Data Types | Variables in C++
Operators in C++
Reference Variable in C++
Operator Overloading in C++
Default Arguments in C++


3. Learn Conditional & Control Statements (Day: 4-5)
Okay, now move to the control flow statements of the C++ programming language. Precisely, control flow statements concerns with the concepts like repeated execution of 
a block of statements – Loops, execution of code based on decision – Decision-Making Statements, etc. You need to cover these concepts thoroughly such as all types of 
loops like For Loop, While Loop, Do While loop, etc. and similarly all decision-making statements like if, if..else, nested if, etc. There are several other topics as
 well that concern with the control flow statements in C++ programming such as Jump Statements, Switch Statements, etc.

Loops in C++
Decision Making in C++
Switch Statements in C++
Continue Statement | Break Statement
Execute both if and else statements in C++


4. Understand Arrays, Strings & Pointers in C++ (Day: 6-8)
Once you’ll get done with the datatypes, variables, and other topics, now you’re required to understand the Arrays & Strings concepts in C++. 
An Array in C++ is used to store similar types of elements and Strings are used to store text or sequence of characters. Moreover, you need to learn about Pointers as 
well that is used for storing the address of another variable. Also, there are several other crucial topics such as Namespaces, Wild Pointers in C++, etc. that can be 
considered.

Arrays | Strings in C++
Pointers in C++
Pointers vs References in C++
Namespaces in C++
Wild Pointers in C++


5. Go Through Functions & OOPs Concepts in C++ (Day: 9-12)
Now, it comes the most crucial part of the C++ programming journey: Functions & OOPS Concepts in C++. 
You need to know about the Functions in C++ which is a set of statements that is created to perform specific tasks. 
You have to learn about function declaration, function overloading, and other topics that concern with functions in C++. 
Meanwhile, you’re required to understand the Object-Oriented programming nature of C++ in-depth with various concepts such as Class, Objects, 
Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation, etc.

Functions in C++
Function Overloading in C++
C++ Classes and Objects
Object-Oriented Programming in C++
Constructors in C++
6. Learn I/O Streams, Dynamic Memory, & STL in C++ (Day: 13-16)
Okay, let’s dive deeper into the world of C programming. Now, you’re required to understand several underlying concepts such as I/O Streams & File Handling in C++, 
Dynamic memory allocation in C/C++, etc. You’re also required to look upon Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ which a renowned feature of the language. 
In general, STL in C++ is a set of C++ template classes that provide general programming data structures and functions like stacks, arrays, etc. Moreover, 
you must have the knowledge of template classes to work on STL in C++.

Files and Streams in C++
Dynamic Memory Allocation in C++
malloc() vs new in C++
Templates in C++
C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
7. Understand Exception Handling, Signal Handling & Multithreading in C++ (Day: 17-20)
Furthermore, you’re required to fetch up the things with some more advanced topics like Exception Handling, Signal Handling, Multithreading in C++, etc. In short, Exception Handlings tends to deal with the code that can throw an exception or error and Signal Handling concerns with the Signals which force an OS to stop its in-progress task and address the task for which the interrupt has been sent. Moreover, you’re required to use POSIX Threads for multithreading in C++.

Signal Handling in C++
Stack Unwinding
Multithreading in C++
